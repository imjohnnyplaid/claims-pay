Currently, the admin portal has a horizontal top navigation bar. I want to refactor it into a vertical left sidebar navigation, similar to Stripe's Dashboard in terms of layout and functionality (e.g., fixed sidebar on the left, collapsible sections with icons, hover/active states, responsive collapse on mobile, ability to minimize nav so that only the icons are visible). The font size for nav items should be 14px. The navigation should be structured like this for the admin (internal) portal:

The sidebar should be ~240px wide on desktop, fixed position, with a subtle shadow, dark/light theme support (use CSS variables), and smooth transitions for expand/collapse. On mobile/tablet (<768px), it collapses to a hamburger menu overlay. Ensure it integrates seamlessly with my existing Replit app code (assume React/Next.js or vanilla HTML/CSS/JS structure—adapt as needed). The main content area should shift right with padding-top matching the sidebar height.
Generate the full updated code and any JS for interactivity (e.g., toggle collapse). Include sample active states and responsiveness. Keep it modular so I can swap in my real nav items later for each portal.

Internal Portal navigation:
1. Top section (always visible): User profile dropdown (avatar, first name) with carat/angle down icon to the right of name.
    1. Icon: user; Text: Profile
    2. Icon: sign out; Text: Sign out
2. Main Navigation (simple list with icons to the left of text)
    1. Icon: house; Text: Home
    2. Icon: code; Text: Coding
    3. Icon: transaction, money, or wallet; Text: Transactions
    4. Icon: star-of-life; Text: Providers
    5. Icon: bank; Text: Banks
3. Manage (below main nav, as a sub-list) — Put subheading “Manage” above list
    1. Icon: users; Text: Users
    2. Icon: lightning bolt; Text: System status
    3. Icon: report, document, or chart; Text: Reports
    4. Icon: hammer, wrench, or test-related icon; Text: Testing
